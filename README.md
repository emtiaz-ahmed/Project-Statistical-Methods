## Task 1: Quality Control ##
**1. Biographic Data:** Draw the barplot for gender distribution; histogram for age distribution. </br></br>
**2. Trait Psychometric Data:** Draw the histogram for TAI scores. Please consider only the total TAI score, which can be found at the *tp.csv file residing at the root of each subject file system. TAI takes values in the range 20-80, with scores up to low 40s considered normal, while higher scores considered indicative of overanxious individuals.</br></br>
**3. State Psychometric Data:** For each subject draw the barplots for all the NASA-TLX subscales per task. This will give two figures per subject per subscale, one for suturing and one for cutting, where the evolution of the scores from the initial to the final session will be evident. There should be a downward trend, reflecting increased facility with the tasks. Keep in mind that NASA-TLX subscales are scored in the range 1-20.</br></br>
**4. Perinasal Perspiration (Stress) Signal Data:** For each session of each subject draw the stress signals, using black for baseline, green for cutting, and red for suturing. Generally speaking, the baseline signal should be at a lower level than the other two. In total, you will draw five figures for each subject or whatever the number of his/her sessions is. It is worth noting that the sampling rate fluctuates around 7 frames per second. We suggest that you downsample to 1 frame per second and use these downsampled signals to perform statistics. This averaging will give you a smoother signal without affecting the validity of the data, as arousal responses manifest in 2-4 seconds, that is, at a resolution higher than the averaging that we suggest.</br></br>
**5. Performance Data:** Draw the time barplots for each subject, using different colors for each task (cutting vs. suturing). You should observe a downward trend for the cutting task. Draw also the accuracy barplots for each subject, using different colors for each task (cutting vs. suturing). You should observe an ascending trend. Please note that there are two accuracy variables: one provides an overall accuracy score, while the other indicates the number of sutures properly completed in the allotted time. The allotted time was 20 minutes for the suturing task, while it was task-dependent for the cutting task.</br></br>
